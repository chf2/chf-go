# chf-go

chf-go a lightweight ruby web framework and PostgreSQL ORM with Rack
integration. It is primarily comprised of a base Model, a base Controller, and a
router. Static assets should be served by default from the `public/` directory,
but this can be changed by modifying the `Rack::Static` configuration in
`config.ru`.
